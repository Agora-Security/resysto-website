# Feature Specification: Website Page Layout Improvement

**Feature Branch**: `001-let-s-improve`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "let's improve the website pages. each page is defined in its own directory under `content`. I'd like to go through each and every page, verify the layout first and the content next. I don't care about tests for this project. I care about a sleeky, future-proof web layout template, which should be simple and not very complex visually, but catchy and captivating. In each page, the sections MUST highlights some key concepts, and then scrolling down the page we should have more information on the highlights. You can find the basic information I want for each page already inside each page directory (for instance, for the "Partners" page you can find the basic content in `content/partners/_index.md`), but each page layout must be improved. the roadmap page layout is reasonably pleasent, but any suggestion to make it better is welcome."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like an implementer**: Every vague requirement should be clear and unambiguous for implementation
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Static site compatibility (no server-side requirements)
   - JavaScript necessity (can it work without JS?)
   - Content structure and navigation
   - Asset optimization requirements

## User Scenarios *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), I want to experience sleek, captivating page layouts that highlight key concepts at the top and provide detailed technical information as I scroll down, so that I can quickly understand the security value proposition and explore in-depth technical content at my own pace.

As a Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Executive Officer (CEO), I want to experience sleek, captivating page layouts that highlight key concepts at the top and provide business-focused information as I scroll down, so that I can quickly understand the business value proposition and explore high-level benefits at my own pace.

### User Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** I am on any website page, **When** I first view the page, **Then** I MUST see key concepts highlighted prominently at the top of the page
2. **Given** I am viewing a page, **When** I scroll down, **Then** I MUST find more detailed information about the key concepts mentioned at the top
3. **Given** I am comparing different pages, **When** I navigate between them, **Then** I MUST experience a consistent layout structure while maintaining page-specific uniqueness
4. **Given** I am viewing the roadmap page, **When** I compare it to other pages, **Then** I MUST find it reasonably pleasant with any improvements that enhance the user experience

### Edge Cases
- **Short content** (<300 words OR <1 screen height): Layout MUST expand to fill available space while maintaining visual balance
- **Medium content** (300-1000 words OR 1-3 screen heights): Layout MUST use standard hierarchical structure with clear section breaks
- **Long content** (>1000 words OR >3 screen heights): Layout MUST include navigation aids (table of contents, back-to-top buttons) and progressive disclosure
- **Media content**: Layout MUST gracefully handle images and media with appropriate loading states and fallbacks
- **Responsive design**: Layout MUST adapt to different screen sizes and devices using mobile-first approach

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display key concepts prominently at the top of each page
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide detailed information sections below the key concepts that expand on the highlights  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to scroll through content in a logical, hierarchical manner
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a consistent layout structure across all pages while allowing for page-specific uniqueness
- **FR-005**: System MUST present a minimalist design with high contrast, clean typography, and subtle animations that is simple yet captivating
- **FR-006**: System MUST use existing content from `content/*/index.md` files as the basis for page information
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure the roadmap page layout maintains or improves user engagement metrics (time on page, scroll depth) and conversion rates for contact/call-to-action elements
- **FR-008**: System MUST create a future-proof layout template that can be easily maintained and updated
- **FR-009**: System MUST comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards
- **FR-010**: System MUST present content that targets both high cybersecurity knowledge (CISO) and medium-to-low cybersecurity knowledge (CIO, CEO) audiences
- **FR-011**: System MUST structure content to provide technical depth for CISO-level understanding while maintaining business clarity for CIO/CEO-level comprehension

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Page Layout Template**: The reusable structure that defines how content is presented across all pages, featuring minimalist design with high contrast, clean typography, and subtle animations
- **Key Concepts Section**: The prominent top section of each page that highlights main ideas for both technical and business audiences
- **Detailed Information Section**: The scrollable content area that expands on key concepts with layered technical and business information
- **Content Hierarchy**: The logical organization of information from high-level to detailed, accommodating both CISO (technical) and CIO/CEO (business) comprehension levels
- **Audience Layering**: The content structure that provides appropriate depth for different cybersecurity knowledge levels

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: The spec mentions creating a "sleek, future-proof web layout template" that is "catchy and captivating." What specific visual design characteristics should define this aesthetic? ‚Üí A: Minimalist with high contrast, clean typography, and subtle animations
- Q: The spec currently only mentions "website visitor" as a user role. Are there specific user personas or roles that should be considered for the layout design? ‚Üí A: Potential customers and partners as distinct personas
- Q: The spec mentions the roadmap page is "reasonably pleasant" but doesn't define what makes a layout "pleasant" or successful. What measurable criteria should be used to evaluate layout success? ‚Üí A: User engagement metrics (time on page, scroll depth) and conversion rates for contact/call-to-action elements
- Q: The spec doesn't address accessibility requirements. What level of accessibility compliance should the layout template meet? ‚Üí A: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Q: The spec mentions handling edge cases like "very little content" and "extensive content" but doesn't define specific thresholds. What content length thresholds should trigger different layout behaviors? ‚Üí A: Short: <300 words, Medium: 300-1000 words, Long: >1000 words AND Short: <1 screen height, Medium: 1-3 screen heights, Long: >3 screen heights
- Q: Before going to the planning phase, can you please improve the spec adding that the webpages content should target people with both high cybersecurity knowledge like a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and medium to low cybersecurity knowledge personell such a Chief Information Security Officer (CIO) or a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) ‚Üí A: Content MUST target both high cybersecurity knowledge (CISO) and medium-to-low cybersecurity knowledge (CIO, CEO) audiences
