# Tasks: Website Page Layout Improvement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-let-s-improve/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Static website**: `content/`, `templates/`, `static/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume static website - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.7: Data Model Implementation
- [ ] T029 [P] Create Page entity structure in content files
- [ ] T030 [P] Implement Section entity with hierarchical structure
- [ ] T031 [P] Set up MediaAsset entity with optimization
- [ ] T032 [P] Create LayoutTemplate entity with components
- [ ] T033 [P] Implement UserPersona targeting system
- [ ] T034 [P] Set up PerformanceBudget validation
- [ ] T035 [P] Create ComponentStyling configuration

## Phase 3.8: Research-Driven Implementation
- [ ] T036 [P] Implement component-based layout system with semantic HTML5
- [ ] T037 [P] Create layered content structure for dual audiences
- [ ] T038 [P] Set up performance budgeting with automated optimization
- [ ] T039 [P] Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML
- [ ] T040 [P] Create mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- [ ] T041 [P] Implement adaptive layout based on content length thresholds
- [ ] T042 [P] Create minimalist visual design with high contrast

## Dependencies
- Content (T004-T007) before templates (T008-T013)
- T008 blocks T009, T011
- T014 blocks T016, T017
- Implementation before polish (T018-T022)
- Content API (T023-T028) after content structure (T004-T007)
- Data model (T029-T035) after content API (T023-T028)
- Research implementation (T036-T042) after data model (T029-T035)

```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Content Structure**:
   - Each content type → content creation task [P]
   - Each navigation item → structure task [P]
   
2. **From Templates**:
   - Each page type → template creation task [P]
   - Each component → implementation task [P]
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → content organization task [P]
   - Each user flow → navigation task [P]
   
4. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → implementation task [P]
   - Each relationship → integration task [P]
   
5. **From API Contracts**:
   - Each endpoint → implementation task [P]
   - Each schema → validation task [P]
   
6. **From Research**:
   - Each decision → implementation task [P]
   - Each mitigation → setup task [P]
   
7. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Content → Templates → Assets → Polish
   - Content before templates (content-first principle)
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
