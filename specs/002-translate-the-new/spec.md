## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: How should existing Zola templates be handled when they have the same names as the new templates from improved_templates? ‚Üí A: Create a backup of existing templates before replacing them
- Q: How should conflicting CSS styles be resolved when merging into the main CSS file? ‚Üí A: New styles completely override existing styles with same selectors
- Q: How should content that doesn't easily translate to markdown be handled? ‚Üí A: Convert to HTML within markdown files using HTML embedding
- Q: What should happen to the original improved_templates directory after translation is complete? ‚Üí A: Keep it as a backup reference
- Q: Which specific pages from improved_templates should be prioritized for translation? ‚Üí A: Start with landing page, then others in order of importance

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website maintainer, I want to translate the new HTML+CSS templates from the improved_templates directory to Zola-compatible templates so that the website can be generated using the Zola static site generator with the updated design.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** HTML templates exist in improved_templates directory, **When** translation is complete, **Then** equivalent Zola templates exist in templates directory
2. **Given** CSS files exist in improved_templates directory, **When** translation is complete, **Then** CSS styles are integrated into the main Zola CSS file
3. **Given** HTML content exists in improved_templates directory, **When** translation is complete, **Then** content is properly structured in the content directory as markdown files
4. **Given** translation is complete, **When** Zola build is run, **Then** website renders with the new design
5. **Given** existing Zola templates have the same names as new templates, **When** translation is performed, **Then** backups of existing templates are created before replacement
6. **Given** conflicting CSS styles exist when merging into the main CSS file, **When** translation is performed, **Then** new styles completely override existing styles with same selectors
7. **Given** content that doesn't easily translate to markdown, **When** translation is performed, **Then** content is converted to HTML within markdown files using HTML embedding

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
