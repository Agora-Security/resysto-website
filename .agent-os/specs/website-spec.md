# Website Project Spec

## Context
- Mission: see `../product/mission.md`
- Tech Stack: see `../product/tech-stack.md`
- Roadmap: see `../product/roadmap.md`

## Objectives
- Launch a static, SEO-optimized site communicating CCC's mission, features, roadmap, partners, about, and access links.
- Minimal JS; responsive via Tailwind.
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions; deploy on `main`, build-check on `develop`.

## Requirements
- Platform positioning: a central Cyber Resilience and Data Protection platform to govern and manage cybersecurity and privacy processes and tools (SaaS product).
- Static Site Generator (Rust): prefer Zola (v0.21) for maturity, content features, and active maintenance; keep cobalt.rs as a viable alternative. Finalize choice early; current default is Zola per `../product/tech-stack.md`.
- Styling: TailwindCSS (v4). Keep the site responsive, simple, captivating, and engaging. Prioritize typography, whitespace, and accessible color contrast.
- JavaScript usage: minimize; favor plain HTML and CSS generated by the SSG. Only allow lightweight progressive enhancement if strictly needed.
- Hosting: GitHub Pages with custom domain (to be decided). Use CNAME when the domain is selected.
- CI policy: publishing updates from `main`; build and checks only from `develop` (no deploy).
- Metadata: Open Graph (`ogp.me`) and Twitter cards with a default social image. Per-page titles and meta descriptions.
- SEO: sitemap.xml, robots.txt, canonical URLs, clean URLs, structured headings, fast-loading static assets.

## Deliverables
- Zola site with pages: `/`, `/features/`, `/roadmap/`, `/partners/`, `/about/`, `/blog/`, `/access/`
- Blog list and post templates with RSS and tags
- Open Graph and Twitter card metadata with default image
- Robots.txt, sitemap.xml, canonical URLs

## Pages
- Landing (`/`):
  - Mission statement for CCC
  - Problems CCC solves (concise, outcome-oriented)
  - Target users: SMB IT, Enterprise CISOs/teams, Cybersecurity advisors/MSSPs
  - Main capabilities: applications (vCISO live; Incident Management in roadmap) and platform services (Documents Manager implementing; RAG and AI assistant planned)
- Features (`/features/`):
  - Clearly separate Applications vs Modules; take inspiration from `https://surrealdb.com/features`
  - vCISO application (implemented): modules include people, documents, tools, asset management, cyber posture, roadmap, supply chain risk management
  - Incident Management (roadmap)
  - Platform services: Documents Manager (implementing), RAG (planned), AI assistant (planned)
- Roadmap (`/roadmap/`):
  - Timeline of applications, modules, and services milestones
- Partners (`/partners/`):
  - Program overview with categories:
    - Managed Service Providers (MSP/MSSP): deliver managed cybersecurity (e.g., vCISO) using CCC
    - Technical partners: integrate IT/Cybersecurity tools to send/retrieve data
- About (`/about/`):
  - Why the platform exists, real-world scenarios, and the company behind it (`https://www.agorasecurity.it/`)
- Blog (`/blog/`):
  - Articles on platform characteristics, features, usage, and value
- Access (`/access/`):
  - Links to two external web consoles: CCC platform console and MSSP console

## Acceptance
- Meets criteria in `../product/acceptance-criteria.md`

## Risks & Mitigations
- Domain not decided: use placeholder base_url; add CNAME later
- Branding TBD: ship neutral, clean theme with Tailwind; add logo later
- JS creep: enforce no runtime JS policy, allow only progressive enhancement if needed
