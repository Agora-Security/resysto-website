# Product Mission (Lite)

Cyber Control Center (CCC) is a Cyber Resilience and Data Protection platform that helps IT teams, CISOs, and MSSPs govern and manage cybersecurity and privacy programs by unifying processes, tooling, and evidence in one SaaS.

CCC serves SMB IT managers, enterprise CISOs, and MSSP advisors who need a single place to run vCISO programs and scale security operations. Unlike point tools, CCC combines application workflows (vCISO today; Incident Management next) with shared services (Documents Manager, planned RAG and AI assistant) to reduce overhead and accelerate compliance.
