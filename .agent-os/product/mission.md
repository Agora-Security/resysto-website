# Product Mission

## Pitch

Cyber Control Center (CCC) is a Cyber Resilience and Data Protection platform that helps IT teams, CISOs, and MSSPs govern and manage cybersecurity and privacy programs by unifying processes, tooling, and evidence in one SaaS.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- SOHO/SMB IT departments: Run security and privacy without a full-time CISO.
- Enterprise CISOs and security teams: Coordinate risk, posture, and roadmap at scale.
- Cybersecurity advisors and MSSPs: Deliver vCISO and managed services efficiently.

### User Personas

**IT Manager**
- **Role:** Head of IT / Sysadmin
- **Context:** Small-to-mid business lacking dedicated security leadership
- **Pain Points:** Fragmented tools, compliance pressure, limited time
- **Goals:** Centralize security operations, meet audits, reduce incident risk

**CISO**
- **Role:** Chief Information Security Officer
- **Context:** Enterprise environment with distributed teams and complex tooling
- **Pain Points:** Visibility gaps, evidence collection, program alignment
- **Goals:** Demonstrate posture, reduce risk, align roadmap with business

**MSSP vCISO Lead**
- **Role:** Practice lead / Senior advisor
- **Context:** Serves multiple clients with repeatable processes
- **Pain Points:** Manual reporting, tool switching, scaling engagements
- **Goals:** Standardize delivery, automate evidence, increase margins

## The Problem

### Fragmented Security Operations
Organizations juggle many tools and spreadsheets across teams. This causes lost context and overhead in coordination and reporting.

**Our Solution:** One platform to orchestrate processes, data, and artifacts across apps and services.

### Evidence and Compliance Burden
Collecting audit-ready evidence is manual and slow, delaying certifications by months.

**Our Solution:** Built-in document/evidence management and posture tracking accelerate audits.

### Limited Security Leadership for SMBs
SMBs lack a dedicated CISO, making risk management ad hoc and reactive.

**Our Solution:** vCISO app provides structured processes, modules, and guidance.

## Differentiators

### Application + Service Layer Architecture
Unlike tool-specific dashboards, CCC separates applications (vCISO, Incident Management) from shared services (Docs Manager, RAG, AI assistant), enabling reuse and faster expansion.

### Partner-first Delivery
Unlike single-tenant point tools, CCC supports MSSPs with multi-client oversight, standardized playbooks, and access links for both platform and MSSP consoles.

## Key Features

- **vCISO Application:** People, documents, tools, asset management, cyber posture, roadmap, supply chain risk.
