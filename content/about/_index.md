# About resysto

resysto was created to help organizations move from ad-hoc security work to a programmatic approach. We focus on real-world scenarios: limited resources, fragmented tools, and increasing compliance pressure.

## üéØ Our Mission

To democratize enterprise-grade cybersecurity management by providing SMBs and growing organizations with the tools, processes, and guidance they need to build effective security programs.

## üåç Real-World Scenarios

### The SMB Challenge
Small and medium businesses face unique cybersecurity challenges:
- **Limited Security Expertise**: No dedicated CISO or security team
- **Resource Constraints**: Tight budgets and competing priorities
- **Compliance Pressure**: Growing regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA, industry standards)
- **Tool Sprawl**: Multiple point solutions without integration or context

### The Enterprise Reality
Even large organizations struggle with:
- **Fragmented Operations**: Siloed teams and disconnected processes
- **Evidence Collection**: Manual, time-consuming audit preparation
- **Tool Management**: Hundreds of security tools without unified visibility
- **Risk Management**: Ad-hoc approaches without systematic risk assessment
