# Central Cyber Resilience and Data Protection platform

Govern and manage cybersecurity and privacy processes and tools in one place.

## Problems we solve

### Fragmented operations
Too many tools and spreadsheets cause lost context and overhead.

### Evidence burden
Collecting audit-ready evidence is slow and manual.

### Lack of security leadership
SMBs run adâ€‘hoc risk management without a dedicated CISO.

## Built for

- SMB IT teams needing vCISO structure
- Enterprise CISOs and security teams
- Cybersecurity advisors and MSSPs

## Capabilities

### Applications
- **vCISO (implemented)**: people, documents, tools, assets, posture, roadmap, SCRM
- **Incident Management (roadmap)**

### Platform services
- Documents Manager (implementing)
- RAG knowledge (planned)
- AI assistant (planned)
